Comparision of Decision Tree and Random Forest 
### Data Understanding
Used data set from Kaggle a name of data is Bank Marketing Dataset. Each row represents a customer, each column contains customerâ€™s attributes described on the column Metadata.For understanding dataset some ways were attached in the file.
### Feature transformation
This program work with numerical variables. So therefore necessary to transform any non-numeric features to numeric. The ways tried for this purpose are specified in the DataScience.py file.

### Train Data with Decision Tree and Random Forest ML algorithms
For execute sklearn library was used for training.
### Comparison two algorithm
With this system comparison of two ML algorithm are possible. They compare with regression score and accurancy score.For better understanding confusion matrix and classification report are in file.
